## Motivation
<strong> MOTIVATION:</strong> <br>
The motivation behind this project was to create an app that lets users create events and see what events they are attending. We wanted an app where people could host events, see what events they are attending and also add what they want to bring to the event if there is a potluck or a gift registery. Project creation is for the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp 2020/2021

## Description
This application allows a host to schedule an event online , in-person or an announcement for a few different types of events: Potluck & Party. 
Host can send invites to recipients via email, also add items that participants can contribute or gift registries they would like to bring to the event or announcement which is open for all who have access to the application.
Invitees can RSVP to the event with the number of adults & kids, choose available options for potluck & gifts that they would like include. They can view all received invitations from different hosts within their account.
Host can view RSVP details of participants to get a better idea of who will attend the event.

<strong>Features </strong>
The difference between our app and other event planning apps is that we utlize the functions of allowing guests to have a potluck feature and gift registery feature to make the event more oragnized. <br>
